I got 2 strings from parser to excel like:

    Mike#USA,sniper#1,soldier#8,tank#1
    John#Nazi,soldier#18,medic#6,sniper#1

This means:

    Player1 - Mike
    Base - USA
    sniper 1
    soldier 8
    tank 1

    Player2 - John
    Base - Nazi
    soldier 18
    medic 6
    sniper 1

I need to compare 2 strings and show differencies with substraction. Snipers are at different places, but mutually excluded. Soldiers 8 vs 18, so they got -8 both sides. Tank - leave as is, because second player doesn`t have one. After that left medic of Player2 - add to 2 list.

Correct output of differencies:

    Mike
    USA
    tank 1

    John
    Nazi
    soldier 10
    medic 6

Is it possible in VBA ?
